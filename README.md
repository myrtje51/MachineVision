# MachineVision

## Description project
This GIT repository contains all the code that I've written over the course of 5 months for my major internship project where I use machine vision techniques to analyze sensory and image data. This includes IPython NoteBooks en normal Python scripts (Python 3.11). Some of the folders include data but the most important data used in most of the code is not uploaded in this directory since some of the data takes up a lot of space. 

## Description per folder
There are two main folders: 
- Height_and_SurfaceArea_data
- Hyperspectral_Data
